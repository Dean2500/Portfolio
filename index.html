              <div class="section">
                <h3>User Interaction and Decision-Making</h3>
                <p>In cases where the program encounters ambiguous or uncertain data, it presents these findings to the user for review and 
                    decision-making. Users are empowered to determine whether to modify or preserve the identified information, providing a 
                    layer of control and transparency in the anonymization process.</p>
              </div>
              <br>
              
              <div class="section">
                <h3>Automated Synchronization and Efficiency</h3>
                <p>To streamline the anonymization process, the program incorporates automated synchronization features specifically designed 
                    for client-server mode. In this mode, user preferences and modifications are saved and synchronized seamlessly across multiple 
                    devices over a secure connection. This minimizes the need for manual intervention and accelerates the overall deidentification 
                    process. However, in offline mode, changes are saved exclusively to a local file without synchronization across devices. 
                    This distinction ensures efficient data management while catering to different usage scenarios.</p>

                <h3>USBScanner Program Functionality</h3>
                <p>The USBScanner program operates seamlessly in a command-line environment, where user interaction is minimal. 
                    However, its outputs are readily visible throughout its execution.</p>
            </div><br>
            
            <div class="section">
                <h3>Initialization Process</h3>
                <p>Upon its first execution, USBScanner automatically captures and stores information regarding all connected USB ports a
                    nd devices. This initial setup phase occurs silently in the background, without necessitating any user input. 
                    It establishes a comprehensive reference list of known USB devices for subsequent comparisons.</p>
            </div><br>
            
            <div class="section">
                <h3>Comparison with Known USB Devices</h3>
                <p>During subsequent runs, USBScanner compares the current state of connected USB devices with the reference list generated
                    during initialization. It efficiently identifies any new or unknown devices that were not present during the initial scan.</p>
            </div><br>
            
            <div class="section">
                <h3>Listing Unknown Devices</h3>
                <p>USBScanner produces a detailed output, listing all unknown USB devices detected during the comparison process. Each entry 
                    in the output includes essential information such as the Device ID, Name (if available), and Path/Bus details, enabling users

                        <p>
                            The main window of the application is divided into two scrollable displays, each presenting a list of entries containing descriptions 
                            linked to their corresponding URLs. These entries are sorted alphabetically, with the sorting operation executed upon saving and the sorted 
                            sequence preserved within the file.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the settings section, users can access various functionalities. Firstly, they can instantly copy an entry to the clipboard by clicking on it. 
                            Additionally, if the "description is hyperlink" option is selected, the entry format changes to a clickable hyperlink, displaying both the description 
                            and the URL. For example, if the user selects this option and clicks on an entry titled "EVE Academy - How to get into incursions," the format would 
                            be <a href="https://www.eveonline.com/eve-academy/careers/enforcer/incursions">EVE Academy - How to get into incursions</a>. If this checkbox is not 
                            selected, the entry format displays the raw URL only, such as <a href="https://www.eveonline.com/eve-academy/careers/enforcer/incursions">https://www.eveonline.com/eve-academy/careers/enforcer/incursions</a>. Another feature in 
                            this section allows users to delete all data. Upon reloading the application, the file database will be populated with predefined entries.
                        </p>                     
                        <p>
                            In the details section, users can view comprehensive information about the selected entry, including both the link and description. This section 
                            also enables users to perform various actions such as editing, deletion, and addition of entries. Additionally, users can copy the entry to the 
                            lipboard with a single click, eliminating the need to select it twice. Furthermore, the application facilitates the opening of the link associated 
                            with the entry directly in the user's browser for further exploration.
                        </p>

                        <figure>
                            <img src="images/evelinks/search_example.png" alt="Search Example">

                        <p>
                            The search function in the main window provides a dynamic experience by updating the WPF tables in 
                            real-time with each keystroke entered into the search field. The search is case insensitive, 
                            ensuring that matches are found regardless of the letter case used in the search query.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As the user types, the search function checks both the URL and description fields for matches. 
                            This comprehensive search ensures that relevant results are displayed to the user, whether they're 
                            searching for specific URLs or descriptions.
                        </p>    
                        <p>
                            In addition to the search functionality, when an entry is clicked, the program provides additional information 
                            indicating whether it's from a third party or not. This information is crucial given the context in which the 
                            program is used. Even if the user enters something else in the search bar but doesn't click on a new entry,
                            this feature ensures that they are informed about the source of the selected entry. This transparency helps 
                            users make informed decisions and maintain awareness of the origin of the displayed content, enhancing the overall 
                            usability and trustworthiness of the application.
                        </p>
                           
                        <p>
                            To maintain responsiveness and reduce lag, asynchronous threading is employed. This means that 
                            the search operation is performed asynchronously in a separate thread, allowing the user interface 
                            to remain smooth and responsive even during intensive search operations. By leveraging async threading, 
                            the search function delivers a seamless user experience, providing quick and accurate results without sacrificing 
                            performance.

                            The add/edit entry window streamlines the process of adding or modifying entries in the database. 
                            Depending on whether the window is in "add entry" or "edit entry" mode, the behavior differs. 
                            In "add entry" mode, the fields are left empty, enabling users to input new data from scratch, 
                            while in "edit entry" mode, the fields are pre-filled with existing data from the database, facilitating modifications to specific entries.

                        <p>
                            Autofill is an option activated when the URL is from the game developer's affiliated websites, making data entry smoother by automatically 
                            populating fields based on keywords in the URL. If a YouTube link was provided, a web scraper only operates during the final database saving to 
                            confirm the channel's affiliation with the developer, resulting in a slight delay.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After validating and ensuring all information is complete, the system saves or updates the entry. The data is then sorted, and the updated data
                             is saved to maintain database organization and integrity.
