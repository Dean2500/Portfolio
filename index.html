                <h2>Initial Problem</h2>
                <div class="section">
                    <p>Job seekers are required to provide a record of the jobs they applied for to Centrelink, and maintaining this record can offer several benefits. 
                        It serves as a quick reference, allowing individuals to refresh their memory if they are contacted unexpectedly by a potential employer. Additionally,
                         this information can be valuable for job coaches or other support services that assist in the job search process. Recognizing these advantages, this project 
                         was born to help streamline and enhance the job application tracking experience.</p>
                </div>


                <br><br>
                <h2>Challenges</h2>

                <div class="section">
                    <h3>Addressing Navigation Challenges in the App</h3>
                    <p>The initial system navigation bar proved to be nearly impossible to use, with some activities becoming completely unmanageable due to issues 
                        like white icons on a white background—an inexplicable problem. Attempts to rectify the issue were unsuccessful, as they only allowed for color 
                        changes that fit the app's theme but did not enhance usability. Given the considerable time already invested in trying to fix this problem, it 
                        became clear that building a custom navigation bar would be a more efficient solution. This new interface provides basic navigation options beyond 
                        the standard "back" and "home" buttons. To facilitate this, the app was designed to run in full screen, hiding the system navigation bar to encourage 
                        users to rely solely on the new interface.</p>

                    <p>However, I am currently addressing an ongoing issue where the system navigation bar occasionally reappears when users tap the screen or 
                        perform specific actions. From what I can gather, this behavior seems to be semi-forced by Android for understandable reasons, but it 
                        occurs unreliably; on some devices, it happens frequently while on others, it never appears. The annoyance is that when it does pop up, 
                        users must tap twice to perform actions—the first tap brings up the navigation bar, while the second is needed to activate the app's features.</p>
                    
                    <p>A second challenge emerged when testing the app on various devices, revealing a lack of uniformity in the system navigation bar. Some devices position
                         the back button on the left, while others place it on the right. To address this inconsistency, I implemented a customizable navigation bar that allows
                          users to choose between two themes: one with the back button on the left and the other on the right. This flexibility ensures that users can select 
                          their preferred layout, avoiding the frustrating experience of pressing the wrong button due to muscle memory.</p>
                </div><br>

                <div class="section">
                    <h3>PDF Exporting</h3>
                    <p>To create a file format that supports text formatting and is globally accepted, I chose PDF. However, this decision led to a series of challenges.
                         One of the first hurdles was selecting a suitable library that could accomplish the required tasks without too many complications. My efforts to 
                         find a viable library were unsuccessful, as many either didn’t work, were too expensive, or required sharing my code due to licensing 
                         restrictions—something that was not acceptable. Ultimately, I opted to use Android's inbuilt library, which, while functional, lacked some 
                         high-end features.</p>
                </div><br>
                
                <div class="section">
                    <h3>Calculating Coordinates</h3>
                    <p>Using an inbuilt library meant I had to calculate various values, such as column positions and page layout, all based on coordinates. 
                        This approach required meticulous planning to determine where to place elements on the page and when to transition to the next one. Since the 
                        coordinates were mostly static, I could minimize the time spent calculating them by hardcoding the frame of a template, adding finer details
                         later as the app began exporting and adjusted for dynamic content, such as user details if provided.</p>
                </div><br>
                
                <div class="section">
                    <h3>Preventing Text Overlap</h3>
                    <p>Additionally, because the layout was coordinate-based and involved varying string lengths, I needed a system to prevent overlap of text.
                         This was achieved by calculating how many characters could fit in a "table column" before reaching the edge, which allowed me to move down
                          a line and reset the x-coordinate while adjusting the y-coordinate to simulate a new line.</p>
                </div><br>
                
                <div class="section">
                    <h3>Aligning User Details</h3>
                    <p>I also encountered challenges when positioning user details to align with the right-hand side of the table. To solve this, I experimented
                         with measuring how much space each character occupied in pixels. Using this data, along with the length of the longest string, I determined
                          the x-coordinate based on the starting point used to draw the box that served as the table header.</p>
                </div><br>
                
                <div class="section">
                    <h3>Designing the Table Header</h3>
                    <p>The table header itself presented another issue, as I needed to draw a black box with padding on both sides of the column headers. 
                        This required a lot of experimentation and fine-tuning. Once the coordinates for this were determined, I drew a black box and set the text to 
                        white to place it inside the boxes, effectively serving as the headers.</p>
                </div><br>
                
                <div class="section">
                    <h3>Template Management</h3>
                    <p>Templates had been an issue of their own. Noticing how the initial implementation handled everything as an image, I opted to generate a template 
                        image the first time the code runs and store the bitmap in memory for the duration of the exporting process. This meant I could paste that template
                         on top of each new page and be ready to resume. However, this came at a cost; the template parts appeared grainy, with some letters looking malformed 
                         or missing. Attempts to rectify this were unsuccessful.</p>

                    <p>As a result, the template system was reworked. Now, all dynamic values are calculated once and stored in memory, allowing the app to use 
                        hardcoded coordinates for static elements and stored dynamic coordinates for the changing parts. This change means calculations are only
                         performed once each time a new page is added, and because the elements are pasted directly onto the new page, the resolution improved, 
                         eliminating the issues seen with the initial template. Additionally, using templates significantly reduced the amount of computation and memory
                          required during the exporting process, making it more efficient.</p>
                </div><br>
            
                <div class="section">
                    <h3>Fitting Content on the Page</h3>
                    <p>Fitting everything on the page posed another significant challenge. To address this, I opted to use a smaller font that minimized horizontal space, a
                        llowing me to maximize the content on each landscape A4 page. The maximum lengths of strings per column, the positions of columns, and the overall
                         positioning of the table all played crucial roles in this process. I needed to keep the content close to the edge of the page; however, printers 
                         generally do not print to the very edge due to mechanical limitations and ink bleeding. Thus, I needed to maintain a buffer area of white space 
                         between the content and the edge of the page to ensure clean and professional-looking prints.</p>
                </div><br>

                <div class="section">
                    <h3>Determining the Page End</h3>
                    <p>Another challenge was programmatically determining when I was near the bottom of the page. To solve this, I kept track of the page height and 
                        triggered a new page if the current y-coordinate approached that height within a set distance. This gap accounted for the possibility of entries
                         spanning multiple lines, ensuring that no content was cropped or overflowed onto hardcoded details at the bottom of the page.</p>
                </div><br>
                
                <div class="section">
                    <h3>Addressing Language Barriers in Exporting Job Search Records</h3>
                    <p>The challenge arose from the differing language preferences of users compared to the app's default language. The solution involved implementing a
                         system that allows users to operate the app in their preferred language while exporting data in a different language. This innovative feature 
                         essentially swaps the app's language to the user's desired choice during export and then reverts it once the process is complete. As a result, 
                         users who feel more comfortable in their native language can easily send a copy of their job search record in a completely different language. 
                         It's important to note that the translations are limited to static content; any information entered by the user remains in its original form.</p>
                </div><br>

                <div class="section">
                    <h3>Tablet or Not Tablet: That Is the Question</h3>
                    <p>There was a need to determine whether a device was a tablet or not. With the help of AI, I was able to generate code that checks a device's
                        resolution to make this distinction. Testing has shown that this AI-developed code works effectively, accurately identifying tablets versus 
                        non-tablets and ensuring that the app can deliver an optimized experience tailored to each device type.</p>
                </div><br>
                
                <div class="section">
                    <h3>Create a Dynamic Table on the Home Page</h3>
                    <p>To enhance user experience, there was a need for a dynamic table on the home page that could efficiently utilize the available screen space. 
                        By adapting the layout based on device type and orientation, the app could present information in a more organized and visually appealing manner.
                         Each time a search is performed, the table is destroyed and recreated, ensuring it always reflects the most relevant data. Additionally, 
                         each row is assigned an `onClick` listener, allowing users to select an entry they wish to edit or view, thereby enhancing interactivity 
                         and user engagement.</p>
                    
                    <p>Part 1 of the solution involved assessing how many columns could be utilized to showcase entries stored in the device’s database, with this
                         determination influenced by whether the device was a tablet or not.</p>
                
                    <p>Part 2 entailed implementing code that evaluates the space occupied by other UI elements and calculates the number of available columns.
                         This data is then used to determine the maximum string length for each column, as well as the total number of rows the table can support. 
                         This ensures a well-structured layout that adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes and orientations.</p>
                    
                    <p>Finally, Part 3 focused on dynamically updating the table in response to real-time changes in the device’s orientation or screen size. 
                        This guarantees that users always have the most optimized view, enhancing usability and overall experience.</p>
                </div><br>
                
                <div class="section">
                    <h3>Process User Input</h3>
                    <p>The challenge was to ensure that user input is in the correct format while providing multiple options for different data types. 
                        This was largely achieved through the use of regular expressions (regex). With the assistance of AI, I was able to fine-tune the regex t
                        o accurately identify a wide range of formats, including URLs, phone numbers, and email addresses, ensuring the input was not just a 
                        string of punctuation but something usable.</p>
                    
                    <p>Additionally, regex was utilized in the user input filters implemented by a TextWatcher. This setup allowed the app to validate 
                        input in real-time: if the input was valid, no action was taken, but if a special character that was not permitted was detected, 
                        it was removed immediately as the user typed. This approach not only enhances the user experience but also ensures data integrity 
                        across the application.</p>
                </div><br>
                
                <div class="section">
                    <h3>Import/Export</h3>
                    <p>When importing data, it often comes from an uncontrolled source, leading to a reduced level of trust in its accuracy. To address this, the best 
                        approach is to assume that users may have altered the data and to implement stringent tests to maintain security and data integrity. 
                        This was achieved through the use of regular expressions (regex), which were employed to identify entries that resemble the expected 
                        format of a single export from my app. If a match is found, further checks are initiated.</p>
                
                    <p>Regex is also utilized to extract all relevant data, ensuring that the process remains robust even if the internal structures of the data change. 
                        The code then verifies data length, checks for illegal characters, and validates formats before accepting any entry. If any of these tests fail, 
                        that particular piece of data is rejected, and the code proceeds to evaluate the next entry. This comprehensive approach helps ensure that only 
                        valid data is imported, safeguarding the integrity of the application.</p>
                </div><br>
                
                
                <div class="section">
                    <h3>Deciding What to Store</h3>
                    <p>Deciding what information to store for online job applications proved to be surprisingly difficult. Initially, I considered storing job reference 
                        numbers and website names, but eventually, I opted to simply store the URL of the job ad. This choice aligned more closely with the app's goal, 
                        as users could easily browse to the website using the link.</p>
                </div><br>
                
                <div class="section">
                    <h3>Increase User Friendliness</h3>
                    <p>The app is already user-friendly, but I believe there is room for improvement, particularly in how data is entered. Currently, users can 
                        only input data by typing, copying and pasting, or using autofill. One potential enhancement I’m exploring is an automatic feature that 
                        populates the text field with a URL when users share a link with the app. This could streamline the process and make it more convenient 
                        for users to log their applications.</p>
                    
                        <p>Another idea, though more complex due to the diversity of email formats, is to enable users to select an email and have the app attempt
                             to autofill based on its contents. However, I acknowledge that this approach may present significant challenges, as there is no 
                             standardized format and the content can vary widely. Additionally, if I were to pursue the email reading feature, I would need to 
                             invest considerable effort in ensuring security, as I cannot assume that users won't select an email containing a virus by mistake.</p>

                    <h3>User Onboarding</h3>
                    <p>To effectively teach users the basics of how to use the app, I recognized the need for a comprehensive onboarding solution. I decided to create an 
                        up-to-date tutorial and guides section that includes videos providing a step-by-step walkthrough of the app's features. This approach caters to
                         visual learners, allowing them to see the process in action and better understand how to navigate the app.</p>
                    
                    <p>The guides have been integrated into the ViewModel state-saving system that Android provides. While this was not its original intended purpose, 
                        it effectively ensures that the correct guides are displayed when the screen rotates or when the user exits and returns to the app. 
                        This integration also eliminates the need for duplicate code, as the observers monitor changes in the selected guide and trigger the
                         necessary code to swap displays and load the new guide seamlessly.</p>

                    <h3>Choosing the Programming Language</h3>
                    <p>The group project was primarily run on Linux, necessitating that the code be compatible with that platform. While exploring options, 
                        I considered using Java, but I encountered difficulties getting the USB scanning library to work. C# was also not viable due to its USB 
                        library being Windows-only. Ultimately, I decided to stick with Python, which offered built-in functionality for my needs. I was able to 
                        find workable code that served as a guide for building the USB scanning functionality.</p>

                    <h3>Identifying Unknown Devices</h3>
                    <p>I needed a method to identify unknown devices connected to the PC. The solution involved creating a script that utilized a text file listing all known devices. During each scan, the script would compare the detected devices against the known list, removing any matches from the results. This allowed the script to output to the user, as well as to a separate file, all the devices that remained, effectively highlighting the unknown ones. This functionality requires the script to be run at least once without the device you're trying to identify connected, as the script will create a file of known devices if it runs without that file existing. This file can easily be edited later, allowing devices to be added or removed as needed without breaking the script.</p>

                        details provided by the scan. Consequently, I couldn't afford to crop the data away. I opted to use an object to represent the USB device, 
                        which allowed for easy access to the relevant parameters necessary for cross-comparing scanned devices with known ones. This approach preserved 
                        the rest of the data, ensuring it could be easily saved to a file in a format that my script could later parse and reconstruct.</p>

                <h2>Initial Problem</h2>
                <div class="section">
                   <p>As part of a university project working with fellow students, we were requested to build a deidentifier for sensitive information, 
                    such as logs and IP packets, to support machine learning models. It was crucial to obfuscate this data to protect privacy while still
                     retaining underlying patterns that would keep the information useful. To meet this challenge, we developed a program designed to render 
                     the data unidentifiable while ensuring it remained functional for testing and analysis, allowing us to safely handle sensitive information
                      in our collaborative project.</p>

                <div class="section">
                    <h3>Secure Communication Over a Network</h3>
                    <p>The program included an option for communication over a network, which meant that the data in transit needed to be secure. 
                        To address this, we researched secure sockets and successfully implemented secure communication in Java, ensuring that all required 
                        parameters were passed accurately to the libraries. This task proved to be quite challenging due to the complexity of secure sockets;
                         even minor errors in these specific values could cause the system to crash with little explanation.</p>
                </div><br>
                
                <div class="section">
                    <h3>Comprehensive Data Processing</h3>
                    <p>We faced the challenge of finding all data that needed to be processed and ensuring that nothing was overlooked. 
                        To address this, we implemented a system utilizing polymorphism and a loop that allowed us to add all tests to a single ArrayList.
                         This setup enabled the tests to run on every single line from various sources, including files, logs, and file paths. Our tests were
                          designed to check for patterns resembling IP addresses, emails, IDs, and more. Additionally, we included checks for file paths, file names,
                           and directories, all of which would be altered if they matched any of the filters.</p>
                    
                    <p>To ensure every file was checked, we employed a recursive search approach, allowing the code to start from a defined point and explore 
                        all subsequent paths. If a match was found, the data would be deidentified, prompting user input only if it reached a level of ambiguity 
                        concerning names. The code was also case insensitive and attentive to punctuation, requiring meticulous letter-by-letter examination to
                         ensure that cases like "n|name|1232342" were not missed. Furthermore, since changing dates and times was a requirement, we implemented 
                         modifications to these as well, arguing that it should be impossible for someone to view security cameras and identify individuals referenced
                         by the deidentified data.</p>

                <div class="section">
                    <h3>Preserve Data Format</h3>
                    <p>We encountered the challenge of preserving the original data format while deidentifying sensitive information. The program was designed to remember 
                        the first instance of any data it encountered and track any changes made. If the same data appeared again, it would replace it with the updated value 
                        or an alternative specified by the user if it reached that level of input. Additionally, the modified data needed to conform to the original format; 
                        for instance, a name would be transformed into a jumbled version of itself, an email would become a jumbled email, and IP addresses would remain
                         identifiable as IPs but altered. This ensured that the integrity of the data format was maintained throughout the deidentification process.</p>
                </div><br>
              
                <div class="section">
                    <h3>Reduce False Positives and User Action Requirements</h3>
                    <p>We faced the challenge of minimizing false positives and reducing the need for user intervention. To achieve this, we 
                        identified common Linux commands and other irrelevant entries that appeared in the test data, programming the system to ignore them. 
                        Additionally, we allowed users to add their own items to this exclusion list, enhancing flexibility. The program’s ability to track 
                        changes also contributed to reducing false positives and limiting the frequency of user actions. As a result of these improvements, we 
                        successfully decreased a list of over 100 results down to around 30, as the program effectively ignored unnecessary commands and uncovered 
                        structured data—such as IP addresses and emails—hidden within punctuation.</p>

                    <h3>Processing IP Packets from a Network Capture</h3>
                    <p>We faced the challenge of checking and editing IP packets from network captures without compromising the integrity of the packets.
                         To achieve this, we utilized a third-party library while creating new IP addresses ourselves. This approach allowed us to use the library
                          to examine every single packet, facilitating the checking and modification of source and destination IP addresses to render them deidentified. 
                          By carefully managing these processes, we ensured that the essential structure of the packets remained intact while effectively anonymizing
                           sensitive information.</p>

                    <p>We faced the challenge of preserving the original files while still deidentifying the data contained within them. To address this, 
                        the code was designed to create a copy of all processed data in the deidentified form within the root directory of its execution. 
                        This approach ensured that users could access the altered files without the risk of corrupting or damaging the original files.</p>

                    <h3>Facilitating Easy Addition of Tests and Checks</h3>
                    <p>This aspect highlighted the advantage of using polymorphism, as it allowed all deidentifying code to accept a consistent format and return 
                        a specific structure. In this case, the structure was a wrapper containing the original value, the changed value, and information about any
                         issues that occurred. As a result, the order of the tests was enforced by the sequence in which they were registered in the ArrayList. 
                         This list was then processed using a for-each loop, which would only break out if an issue arose or if all tests were exhausted. 
                         The name deidentifying check was placed last in the sequence, functioning as the catchall to handle any remaining cases.</p>

                    <p>Following the start of my university semester, my involvement in the project decreased, leaving me with limited insights into the tool's impact. However, 
                        I thoroughly enjoyed the challenge of developing the deidentifier tool. Breaking down complex problems and finding solutions was both stimulating and rewarding. 
                        The tool effectively deidentifies sensitive data across multiple computers using secure communication protocols. While I don’t have updates on user feedback from 
                        the authorized requester, the process of tackling these challenges has deepened my understanding of data privacy and security.</p>

                <div class="section">
                    <p>When answering questions, you needed to respond within one minute. The existing system relied on a notepad within the game, 
                        which required finding the notepad and navigating through a complex array of notes to address various inquiries. This method 
                        was inefficient and cumbersome. To solve this issue, the program was developed and used, enabling rapid searches for 
                        data without needing to finish typing. With additional copy and paste support, users could quickly transfer information into 
                        chat, streamlining the process significantly.</p>

                <div class="section">
                    <h3>Running Concurrently with the Game</h3>
                    <p>To address the need for the program to run alongside the game, I minimized the window size of the application, 
                        ensuring it occupied as little space as possible on a second screen. This approach allowed the program to operate efficiently
                         without consuming excessive memory, maintaining reasonable responsiveness even while the demanding game was in progress.</p>
                </div><br>
                
                <div class="section">
                    <h3>Redundancy</h3>
                    <p>The search process was memory-intensive, primarily due to the numerous objects being created and the dynamic generation of the clickable
                         list in the tables displaying entries of interest. This could have contributed to some crashes in the program (though I can't recall the 
                         specifics, as it was a while ago). I addressed the issue by using a garbage collector along with cleanup code to run after each search. 
                         While this was not a perfect solution, it effectively alleviated the memory issues the program was experiencing at the time and reduced some
                          sources of crashes.</p>
                
                    <p>I also conducted thorough tests by using the program myself, along with unit tests and stress tests over time, to identify and address issues
                         that caused the program to crash. It took considerable time and effort, but I ultimately made the program very difficult to crash, even through
                          deliberate actions.</p>

                <div class="section">
                    <h3>Table Creation</h3>
                    <p>The onclick events for the table were not functioning as intended due to the initial build process being semi-static and semi-dynamic, 
                        which caused binding issues. After extensive research, I found a solution that allowed me to dynamically create the entire table from 
                        scratch and bind the onclick events during its creation.</p>
                
                    <p>Additionally, manipulating the table, such as resizing it, could lead to crashes. To mitigate this risk, I identified the necessary flags
                         and stored them as constants, including hard-coded widths and other dimensions. This approach enhanced the efficiency of the dynamic creation
                          process while reducing the likelihood of bugs.</p>

                    <h3>Making the Table UI Look Reasonable</h3>
                    <p>The problem arose when the view containing the table was wider than the table’s columns, resulting in visible edges and a white
                         gap between the table column and the scrollbar. To address this issue, I fine-tuned the maximum width of the table columns in conjunction
                          with the maximum width of the containing view. This adjustment minimized the gap, ensuring that the appearance of the UI was much more cohesive
                           and visually appealing.</p>

                    <p>Resizing the UI resulted in an awkward and unappealing appearance, detracting from the overall user experience. To address this, I opted to disable
                         resizing completely while ensuring that the window was as small as possible while still maintaining usability and convenience. This decision helped 
                         maintain a clean and functional UI, preventing any visual inconsistencies that could arise from user interactions.</p>

                    <p>To enhance ease of use, I consolidated all functionalities into a single window, organizing them into distinct boxes or sections that took up minimal
                         space while remaining visually appealing. This design allowed users to quickly change how information was copied and view additional details without
                          cluttering the interface. A new window would only open when adding or editing an entry in the main list, streamlining the workflow and keeping the

                    <p>The program displays entries in alphabetical order, which was achieved through a straightforward approach that minimizes processing. Sorting occurs only 
                        when an entry is added or updated in the main data files, with the sorted result saved directly to the file. As a result, when the program reads the
                         file, the data is already organized, eliminating the need for additional sorting operations during runtime and enhancing overall performance.</p>

                    <p>Through research, I developed a method to recognize sources from the gaming company, including forum pages, web pages, and other resources. 
                        The program examines the URL for key features that indicate authenticity from the company, which was crucial for ensuring we relied on official 
                        sources rather than third-party content. Additionally, it can extract titles from these URLs to provide autofill options for users. After extensive 
                        testing, I successfully integrated YouTube support, which required a web scraper to retrieve the webpage and identify the posting channel, ensuring 
                        it aligned with the company’s official YouTube channels. This process took longer than expected but ultimately expanded the program's capabilities and 
                        improved the reliability of the information provided.</p>

                                The main window of the application is divided into two scrollable displays, each presenting a list of entries containing descriptions 
                                linked to their corresponding URLs. These entries are sorted alphabetically, with the sorting operation executed upon saving and the sorted 
                                sequence preserved within the file.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the settings section, users can access various functionalities. Firstly, they can instantly copy an entry to the clipboard by clicking on it. 
                                Additionally, if the "description is hyperlink" option is selected, the entry format changes to a clickable hyperlink, displaying both the description 
                                and the URL. For example, if the user selects this option and clicks on an entry titled "EVE Academy - How to get into incursions," the format would 
                                be <a href="https://www.eveonline.com/eve-academy/careers/enforcer/incursions">EVE Academy - How to get into incursions</a>. If this checkbox is not 
                                selected, the entry format displays the raw URL only, such as <a href="https://www.eveonline.com/eve-academy/careers/enforcer/incursions">https://www.eveonline.com/eve-academy/careers/enforcer/incursions</a>. Another feature in 
                                this section allows users to delete all data. Upon reloading the application, the file database will be populated with predefined entries.

                                In the details section, users can view comprehensive information about the selected entry, including both the link and description. This section 
                                also enables users to perform various actions such as editing, deletion, and addition of entries. Additionally, users can copy the entry to the 
                                lipboard with a single click, eliminating the need to select it twice. Furthermore, the application facilitates the opening of the link associated 
                                with the entry directly in the user's browser for further exploration.

                                The search function in the main window provides a dynamic experience by updating the WPF tables in 
                                real-time with each keystroke entered into the search field. The search is case insensitive, 
                                ensuring that matches are found regardless of the letter case used in the search query.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As the user types, the search function checks both the URL and description fields for matches. 
                                This comprehensive search ensures that relevant results are displayed to the user, whether they're 
                                searching for specific URLs or descriptions.
                            </p>    
                            <p>
                                In addition to the search functionality, when an entry is clicked, the program provides additional information 
                                indicating whether it's from a third party or not. This information is crucial given the context in which the 
                                program is used. Even if the user enters something else in the search bar but doesn't click on a new entry,
                                this feature ensures that they are informed about the source of the selected entry. This transparency helps 
                                users make informed decisions and maintain awareness of the origin of the displayed content, enhancing the overall 
                                usability and trustworthiness of the application.

                                To maintain responsiveness and reduce lag, asynchronous threading is employed. This means that 
                                the search operation is performed asynchronously in a separate thread, allowing the user interface 
                                to remain smooth and responsive even during intensive search operations. By leveraging async threading, 
                                the search function delivers a seamless user experience, providing quick and accurate results without sacrificing 
                                performance.

                                The add/edit entry window streamlines the process of adding or modifying entries in the database. 
                                Depending on whether the window is in "add entry" or "edit entry" mode, the behavior differs. 
                                In "add entry" mode, the fields are left empty, enabling users to input new data from scratch, 
                                while in "edit entry" mode, the fields are pre-filled with existing data from the database, facilitating modifications to specific entries.

                                Autofill is an option activated when the URL is from the game developer's affiliated websites, making data entry smoother by automatically 
                                populating fields based on keywords in the URL. If a YouTube link was provided, a web scraper only operates during the final database saving to 
                                confirm the channel's affiliation with the developer, resulting in a slight delay.

                    <h3>Dynamic Table Management</h3>
                    <p>Although it may seem complicated at times, I've learned that it's often more efficient to remove an entire table and rebuild it when the
                         contents change frequently. This approach allows for a working listener to be bound to each row, ensuring that it reacts live to any updates.</p>

                    <h3>Data Management Strategies</h3>
                    <p>I've discovered that it's better to store current information in a main data file, ensuring it remains safe 
                        while only keeping the data you're actively handling in memory. This approach reduces memory usage and adds a level of redundancy, 
                        as all saves happen instantly. By saving data in a pre-sorted manner, you can dump what's in memory and read the file from scratch
                         without needing additional sorting. This ensures that even if the program crashes or closes unexpectedly, no data is lost and sorting only happens once.</p>

                <div class="section">
                    <h3>Efficient Data Handling</h3>
                    <p>The system works by saving data directly to the main data file, then dumping whatever is in memory and reading the file from scratch. 
                        Since the data is pre-sorted at the saving stage, this process eliminates the need for additional sorting, streamlining data retrieval and 
                        enhancing overall efficiency.</p>

                    <h3>Importance of Unit Testing</h3>
                    <p>I utilized unit tests to ensure that core components were functioning correctly between updates. If any tests failed,
                         I would investigate the issues, supplementing the usual debugging process to maintain stability and reliability in the system.</p>

                    <h3>Modular Development</h3>
                    <p>Building in a modular way proved to be a significant time-saver. By developing code in a separate project with a terminal, 
                        I could thoroughly test its functionality before moving it into the main project. This strategy ensured that any issues were 
                        resolved early, reducing the risk of disruptions to the overall system.</p>

                    <p>This project was initiated to address the inefficiencies of an outdated pen-and-paper system, which resulted in slow search times for
                         racer numbers and limited information. I developed an app that allows users to enter a three-digit racer number and receive instant 
                         results, including the racer’s status and timing information, in just seconds. The app needed to be quick and reliable, as it was integral 
                         to the safety system at a checkpoint where competitors can pass at high speeds. While racers typically come individually, there are times when 
                         several may arrive in quick succession, making it essential to provide accurate information instantly to maintain safety and efficiency. Additionally, 
                         the app utilized mobile tower time synchronization, assuming users had their phone settings set to automatic, ensuring that the recorded time of each racer’s 
                         passage was accurate to the millisecond.</p>

                    <p>The app needed to respond quickly without delays, which was achieved through several design choices. 
                        First, the ability to search for and add a racer was handled within the same activity. This design allowed 
                        for seamless display swapping while keeping the keyboard visible, enabling users to transition swiftly from 
                        answering questions to entering a suddenly arriving racer in seconds.
                    </p>

                    <p>Another key feature was the basic autofill function, which automatically converted inputs like "1" into "001" and "10" into "010."
                         This reduced the time spent on data entry, making the process even more efficient.</p>

                    <p>           
                        Additionally, the app incorporated error-checking capabilities. While it reported any errors to the user, it still accepted
                         entries as long as they fell within a valid range. This approach allowed users to prioritize speed over corrections, enabling 
                         them to make adjustments later when there was more time between racers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The user interface was also designed with speed in mind. A simple checkbox was used to indicate a racer's status,
                         allowing users to quickly mark whether a racer was still in the race or had been pulled out at their location. With just a tap to
                         check or uncheck the box and a quick save, users could efficiently manage their workflow and move on to the next racer without unnecessary delays.</p>

                <div class="section">
                    <h3>Use in Outdoor Conditions</h3>
                    <p>The app's user interface was designed with simplicity and visibility in mind, utilizing high-contrast
                         colors such as black and white, along with dark red for error messages. This color scheme ensured that
                          the screen remained readable in various outdoor conditions, whether under direct sunlight or in other 
                          challenging environments. By prioritizing clarity, users could easily access crucial information without 
                          straining their eyes, enhancing overall usability during races.</p>
                </div><br>

                <div class="section">
                    <h3>Ensuring Instant Access</h3>
                    <p>To prevent delays caused by having to unlock a phone, the solution was straightforward: while the app was active, 
                        the phone would remain awake and not enter sleep mode or turn off the screen. Only the user could turn off the screen, 
                        allowing the app to stay open for extended periods without interruptions. This ensured that users could access the app quickly 
                        and efficiently while a racer was approaching, eliminating any potential delays during critical moments.</p>
                </div><br>
                
                <div class="section">
                    <h3>Information Accuracy</h3>
                    <p>The app allows for editing a racer's number and status, but not the time it was logged, ensuring that corrections can be made later 
                        if an incorrect entry was made. This functionality is supported by a visible list of the last few racers added, with the most recent at the top. 
                        Users can quickly check the entries visually, and if something appears incorrect, they can tap to access the editing area for corrections. It is 
                        designed with the understanding that users will only edit a racer's details when they have enough time to do so. While the editing process is efficient,
                         it is not as fast as the swapping between searching and adding racers, which is crucial during high-pressure situations.</p>
                </div><br>
                
                <div class="section">
                    <h3>Redundancy and Reliability</h3>
                    <p>The app was stress-tested to identify potential failures, and each time a breaking point was discovered, code was implemented to address or 
                        prevent that issue from occurring. This included basic checks to determine whether certain actions were necessary; for instance, there was no 
                        need to search for a racer's details if no racers had been logged. If the app found no file containing racer details, it would return results
                         that matched the response for a search where no racers were found. This way, users would perceive the absence of racers without confusion, thereby 
                         enhancing efficiency while maintaining clarity.</p>
                </div><br>
                
                <div class="section">
                    <h3>Keeping Everything Important Visible</h3>
                    <p>To ensure that all critical functionality remained easily accessible, important elements were positioned in the top half, or top third, 
                        of the screen, with minimal content—such as a copyright notice—at the bottom. This design choice was based on the assumption that the keyboard 
                        would be open most of the time, which meant that anything placed in the lower part of the screen would likely be obscured. By keeping essential
                         details in the upper area, the app minimized frustration and delays, enhancing the user experience during fast-paced situations.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Project Outcome</h2>

                <div class="section">
                    <p>The app significantly increased the speed and accuracy of data coming from the checkpoint, enhancing the amount of information available
                         to the official noting competitor numbers and answering questions. This improvement reduced the load on the radio operator, allowing f
                         or more efficient communication. However, the app was never published and ultimately was used only by the developer.</p>

                <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
               <div class="section">
                    <h3>UI Design</h3>
                    <p>One key takeaway from this project was the importance of UI layouts designed for situations where speed is critical. Ensuring that essential
                         functions are easily accessible and visible can greatly enhance user experience in high-pressure environments. This experience reinforced my 
                         understanding of how thoughtful design directly impacts usability and efficiency when every second counts.</p>

                <div class="section">
                    <h3>Efficient File Management</h3>
                    <p>One important lesson learned was the value of in-line file editing. By using fixed-length records, 
                        I discovered that it’s possible to seek to a specific location in a file and replace bytes directly without the need 
                        to rewrite the entire file line by line. This approach not only enhances efficiency but also simplifies the process of
                         data management within the application.</p>

                    <h3>Debugging and redundancy</h3>
                    <p>This project reinforced the importance of debugging and the design of redundant applications through thorough planning. 
                        By anticipating potential failure points and implementing robust checks, I learned how to create apps that are resilient 
                        and difficult to crash. This proactive approach not only improves reliability but also enhances user confidence in the application.</p>
